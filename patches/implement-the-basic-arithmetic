Implement the basic arithmetic operations.

The add has already been implemented, now implement
- subtract
- multiply
- divide, for now always an integral operation, truncating the value

Fixes a bug were the calculation was done in the wrong order. This doesn't
affect addition, but it becomes obvious with subtraction.

Improves the valiation when the stack contains too few elements to do the
calculation. Before a one element stack for a binary operation resulted in an
empty stack.
