# Yet another RPN Calculator

Contains yet another RPN calculator. Although the calculator aims to be useful
for me it's mainly intended to be a toy project to experiment with GitHub
Actions and Clang's modules implementation.

The documentation is [here](https://mordante.github.io/rpn/index.html).
